## My Web Portfolion
I did a few changes considering that we have to use bootstrap as much as possible! I was changing too much the structure between mobile and tablet to computer screen.

<p>This web portfolio is very important to me because this is what I want to work with. Everything that I've learned has been very funny even though sometimes is hard and challenging.
For this assignment, I had to make some modifications for things to work well, and I believe this was good learning, knowing about the limitations of code languages is grateful to me.
The design created was a little disappointing to me, because in the end doesn’t look how I would like, and I needed more time to make more modifications, which is something that I intend to work on. That’s not something that makes me feel bad, because makes part of the learning progress, and I feel that I learned a lot and I’m ready to try again and make it better.
